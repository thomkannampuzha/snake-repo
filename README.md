# About the “Snake Chaos” game
In Snake Chaos, your aim is to help the snake eat as much food as possible to grow longer and earn points, all while avoiding crashes into walls, itself, or surprise bombs. The game ends if the snake hits any of these obstacles. Special food (like stars) gives extra points and bonus growth, but bombs are dangerous traps that can end the game with a cool explosion animation.
You control the snake with the keyboard as it moves nonstop, and the more it grows, the faster it gets—making it harder to stay in control. Sound effects bring the game to life, and the score system keeps track of both your current score and your highest score. The challenge is simple: stay alive and get the highest score.
